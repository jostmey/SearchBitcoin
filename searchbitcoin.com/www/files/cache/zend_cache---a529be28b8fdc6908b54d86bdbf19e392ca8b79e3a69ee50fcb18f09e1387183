		<h1>Learn About Bitcoins</h1>
	<p><img style="float: right;" src="/files/3113/0906/1361/love_bitcoins.png" alt="love_bitcoins.png" width="128" height="128" />Bitcoins are one of the few true digital currencies in existence, and although the technology behind bitcoins is complex, the currency is simple to use. Bitcoins are unique in that they have been designed with security in mind, can be traded online as easily as emails are sent, and are decentralized so that no authority can undermine the transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do people use bitcoins for? Well, you can see from our <a title="Bitcoin Merchandise" href="/index.php?cID=1">search page</a> that you can use bitcoins to buy essentially any commidity or service that you can buy with traditional money. In fact, there are hundreds of businesses that collectively offer tens of thousands of products, and these numbers grow each day at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you get bitcoins? The first step is to download the bitcoin software. The program is easy to install. Once you install it, you will be given a bitcoin address. This is kind of like an email address that is for receiving money online. A typical bitcoin address looks something like ours (<em>1QE66n52DeBhNifskYX6XwQj8u8dE9mAG1)</em>. The bitcoin software may take awhile to sync with the rest of the bitcoin network. If you don't want to wait this long, you can use any of the online bitcoin wallet services, which will operate the bitcoin software for you, to quickly get you your first bitcoin address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have setup a bitcoin account, you can use the <a title="Get some free bitcoins" href="http://dailybitcoins.org/">bitcoin daily</a>&nbsp;to get your first&nbsp;<em>bit-change</em> for free. The bit-change will be sent to your account and saved on your computer (all coins are saved into a special file called the wallet file). If you want more bitcoins you will probably have to purchase them from an <a title="Directory of bitcoin exhanges." href="http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins">exchange</a>. The exchanges are websites where people buy and sell bitcoins. We suggest that you sign-up at an exchange now, because it typically can take up to a week to verify your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/files/cache/bfd04b57544cea267655d0cc754b7e7b.png" alt="Screenshot.png" width="398" height="200" />You can also use the bitcoin software to generate new bitcoins. Wait! You can just print off new money in this currency? Well, yes, but it becomes harder to generate new bitcoins as more and more are made. Bitcoins were designed like this on purpose, to ensure a limited supply of bitcoins. In fact, there is a limit on the total number of bitcoins that can be generated. We recommend against trying to generate new bitcoins, unless you have a high-end model computer. Otherwise, you may be waiting around for a long time.</p></div>
