s:938:"<p>Several people in the bitcoin community informed us that our <a title="Homepage" href="http://www.searchbitcoin.com">homepage</a> was confusing to figure out for first time users. This prompted us to redesign some of the menus. We think that the changes we've made make the hompepage easier to use. Here are some of the changes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>With just one mouse click you can now visit the store selling merchandise seen on our homepage.</li>
<li>You can now leave comments and reviews about any bitcoin store that you have had experience with so that other people may see what you wrote before buying.</li>
<li>Vendors can now subscribe to their store's reviews, so that they can see what people are writing about their business.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are always trying to improve our website. If you have any feedback then leave us a comment below or contact us <a title="Contact Us" href="/contact-us/">here</a>.</p>";
