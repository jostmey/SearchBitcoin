<p>In order for bitcoin to continue growing, the bitcoin community will have to find new uses for the currency. Bitcoin holders may no longer be able to rely on speculation to keep the price of their money high. New, alternative sources of activity that will attract people to the currency are now required.</p>
<p><br />Thus, the bitcoin community may need to focus additional attention and resources to encourage greater use of bitcoin in e-commerce. This is already starting to happen. Just in the past few months, several large online bitcoin stores opened their doors for business. But this is just a start. More bitcoin businesses are needed, and these businesses will need the support of the community to remain financially afloat.</p>
<p><br />Bitcoins have great potential. But innovation is required to realize the dream of a truly decentralized, Internet based currency.</p>
