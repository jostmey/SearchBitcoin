Version 1.0 -- Initial version
Version 1.1 -- Fixed a bug (database error if the maxWidth or maxHeight was
  blank), removed some unnecessary logging.  Verified block is searchable.
Version 1.2 -- Added a clearing div above the block (in addition to the one below it) 
  and wrapped the whole block in a div -- this should eliminate the chance of breaking a floating layout
  Also handled the case where the caption is wider than the image.  Now the div containing
  the caption and image has the same width as the image.
  Removed the <style> tags from the template and replaced them with inline styles
  to produce valid HTML.
Version 1.21 -- Fixed bug, previously set checkbox was not showing as set in edit mode.
Version 1.22 -- Fixed bug: When editing the block, an attempt to replace the image was
  resulting in a link to the image being inserted in the content block and the original
  image left unchanged.  This was being caused by the fact that the ccm_chooseAsset method
  in editor_init was receiving the callback from the asset library instead of the image
  helper code.  To fix the bug, I removed that method from editor_init.  I tried
  to leave the ability to insert a file link in the content block, but still got the conflict.
  Removed both the 'Add Image' and 'Add File options from editor_controls (after copying
  that element inside the package).
  Also added validation if no Image is selected and combined most of the common code
  in add.php and edit.php into a new template: form.php
Version 1.23 -- Minor: removed Log::addEntry() calls inadvertently left in the block controller.
