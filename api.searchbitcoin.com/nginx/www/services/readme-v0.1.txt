WELCOME:

	Welcome! Our mission is to make the bitcoin economy discoverable to the public. That is why we have built a database
	containing virtually every item of bitcoin merchandise for sale in the economy, and why we are offering access to our
	database through our API found here. By helping people discover merchandise and services for sale in the bitcoin
	economy, we hope to stimulate the use of bitcoins as a retail currency. It is our dream to see bitcoins	become more
	that just cryptographic keys traded at MtGox.

RULES FOR USAGE:

	You must have permission from us before releasing a product or service using our database. You will also have to agree
	to these conditions. Be sure that you have read these over.

	* You may not build your own database by “pulling” the data from ours.
	* You may not modify the links or the order of the search results.
	* We reserve the right to run advertisements through the search results. Any advertisements will be flagged as such in the
	  request.
	* We suggest that you indicate to the users which result/s are advertisements.
	* We will not charge a vendor submission fee.
	* We will disclose the amount each advertiser has paid us in a publicly accessible page. Contact us for the page you can 
	  link to.
	* All requests to submit a new website to the search engine must go through us. Contact us for the page you can link to.
	* All requests to have a website removed from the search engine must go through us. Contact us for the page you can link to.
	* You can credit us however you see fit. “Powered by SearchBitcoin” sounds nice.

ERRORS / EMERGENCY / MAINTENANCE:

	In the event of an error please contact me at 'jostmey@gmail.com'. If you feel the situation is urgent you may call me at
	(417) 540-8028. This is a United States phone number.

	We reserve the right to temporarily shut the service down every Sunday for a few hours starting at 11:00PM CST to work on
	the backend. We will rarely (if ever) need to take advantage of this down-time.
