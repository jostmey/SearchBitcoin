INTRO:

	Before releasing a product or service using our database you must first read the "readme" file, which located is in this
	folder.

EXAMPLE REQUEST AND EXPLANATION:

	Below is an example of how to include an image in your website of an item in our database. Be sure that you use the URL
	listed below when making the request (notice the ".php" extension has been dropped).

	 	<img src="http://api.searchbitcoin.com/services/image/21550/large" />

	This snippet of HTML will load an image of the item with "id=21550" in your website. The image will be of larger size if
	a larger size of the image is available.

	Here is a more detailed explanation of the URL parameters.

		<img src="http://api.searchbitcoin.com/services/image/{$id}/{$size}

		id: An integer value returned from the FEED API or SEARCH API. The id value acts as the primary key for the database
			and will identify the image to load.
		size: A string that picks the size of the image to use. There are two options: "small" and "large". The default
			value, which is used if the parameter is omitted, is "small". Images of size "small" will fit into a 50px
			by 50px box. Note, that the image could actually be smaller than the 50px by 50px. The other option, "large",
			will return an image that can fit within a 100px by 100px box. In cases where large images of 100px by 100px
			are not available, smaller images will be returned.
