INTRO:

	Before releasing a product or service using our database you must first read the "readme" file, which located is in this
	folder.

EXAMPLE REQUEST AND EXPLANATION:

	Below is an example of how to submit a vote request to our database. Be sure that you use the URL listed below when making
	the request (notice the ".php" extension has been dropped).

	 	http://api.searchbitcoin.com/services/vote?id=21550&vote=1&callback=btcvote"

	This example request will cast a vote on the item with "id=21550". The vote will be an upvote as indicated by "vote=1".
	A confirmation of the vote will be returned in a JSON formatted array padded with the callback function "btcvote"

	Here is a more detailed explanation of the URL parameters. All URL parameters are optional.

		id: An integer value returned from the FEED API or SEARCH API. The id value acts as the primary key for the database
			and will identify what item was being voted on.
		vote: An integer value an Upvote or Downvote. An upvote is cast when "vote=1" and a downvote is cast when "vote=-1".
		callback: String giving the name of the callback function to use to pad the JSON request (JSONP). If the parameter is
			not used then the callback function will be omitted, and request will not be padded (just JSON).

EXAMPLE RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION:

	Here is an example response to a vote submission.  This example response is formatted in JSON and shows that the vote was
	rejected.

		{
			"return":"error",
			"messages": [
				"You have reached the maximum allowed daily votes from your address.",
				"A server error occurred and the database connection timed-out."
			]
		}

	Here is a description of the variables.

		* return: Either "success" or "error".
		* messages: An array of messages either confirming that a vote was accepted ("success") or providing an explanation
			as to why a vote was rejected ("error").
