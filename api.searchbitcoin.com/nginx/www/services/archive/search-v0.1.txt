DISCLAIMER:

	Welcome! Our mission is to make the bitcoin economy discoverable to the public. We are pleased to bring you access
	to our database of bitcoin businesses and merchandise. Before you start pulling data from out feeds, be sure that
	you have prior permission from us, and that you have agreed to our terms. If you have done this already then you
	are ready to go!

ERRORS / EMERGENCY / MAINTINANCE:

	In the event of an error please contact me at 'jostmey@gmail.com'. If you feel the situation is urgent you may call me at
	(417) 540-8028. This is United States phone number.

	We reserve the right to temporarily shut the service down every Sunday for three hours starting at 11:00PM CST. In general,
	there should be no reason for us to shutdown, and we will keep our service running through these hours.

PATHS (URL) TO DATA:

	The following URL is for pulling JSON data from our services.

		http://api.searchbitcoin.com/apps/btcsearch/hooks/search.json

	The JSON data can be padded with a callback function simply by changing the extension on the URL to ".js". The
	callback function is by default "btcsearch". However, the callback function can also be specified as a URL GET
	parameters as follows:

		http://api.searchbitcoin.com/apps/btcsearch/hooks/search.js?callback={NAME_OF_CALLBACK_METHOD}

	If you use jQuery to make the JSONP request then it may be necessary for you to specify the callback parameter.
	If you need the data in another format, say XML, then contact us and we can set it up.

ANATOMY OF SEARCH RESULTS:

	The basic search result will be of the following form:

		[

				"title": "Red Card",
				"description": "This red car is fast",
				"url": "http:\/\/www.example.com\/merchandise\/car\/",
