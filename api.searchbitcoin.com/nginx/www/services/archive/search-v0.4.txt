RULES FOR USAGE:

	Welcome! Our mission is to make the bitcoin economy discoverable to the public. We are pleased to bring you access
	to our database of bitcoin businesses and merchandise. Before you start pulling data from out feeds, be sure that
	you have prior permission from us, and that you have agreed to our terms. If you have already done this then you
	are ready to go!

ERRORS / EMERGENCY / MAINTENANCE:

	In the event of an error please contact me at 'jostmey@gmail.com'. If you feel the situation is urgent you may call me at
	(417) 540-8028. This is a United States phone number.

	We reserve the right to temporarily shut the service down every Sunday for a few hours starting at 11:00PM CST to work on
	the backend. We will rarely (if ever) need to take advantage of this down-time.

EXAMPLE REQUEST AND EXPLANATION:

	Below is an example search request using the same URL that you should use to make the request.

	 	http://api.searchbitcoin.com/service/search?query=laptop&number=10&exact=0&order=forward&format=json&callback=btcsearch

	This example request will return 10 search results for the keyword "laptop". If there are less than 10 matches the blank
	search results will be filled with the most popular items in the database. The order of the data will be returned such that
	the most relevant results come first. The data will be returned in JSON format padded with the callback function "btcsearch".

	Here is a more detailed explanation of the URL parameters. All URL parameters are optional.

		query: A string containing the search query. The string should be percent encoded, though this is probably not
			critical. The default value is "laptop".
		number: Integer indicating the desired number of search results. The value must be between 1 and 15. The default
			value is 10.
		exact: Boolean value (0 or 1) indicating if the matches have to be exact. If the matches do not have to be exact
			then any null search results will be filled with the most popular items in the database. If the matches have
			to be exact then the number of returned search results may be less than the requested number of search
			results. The default value is false (0).
		order: String indicating the order in which the search results are returned. Use 'forward' to indicate that the most
			relevant search results should come first. Use 'reverse' to indicate that the results should be returned
			with the most relevant search results at the bottom (this option allows for a quick fix if you notice the
			results are up-side down in rank). Use 'random' to have the search results arranged in a random order. The
			default ordering is "forward".
		format: String indicating the data format to use when returning the search results. The current options are limited
			to JSON and HTML (for debugging). However, other data formats will be added if requested. The default value
			is JSON.
		callback: String giving the name of the callback function to use to pad the JSON request (JSONP). If the parameter is
			not used then the callback function will be omitted, and request will not be padded (just JSON).

EXAMPLE RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION:

	Here is an example response to a search query. This example response is formatted in JSON and contains just 2 results. The
	callback function is omitted.

		{

			"items": [
				{
					"domain": "www.example.com",
					"title": "Red Card",
					"description": "This red car is fast",
					"url": "http:\/\/www.example.com\/merchandise\/car.html",
					"image": "http:\/\/www.example.com\/images\/\/red-car.jpg",
					"price": "100 BTC",
					"marketing": "none"
				},
				{
					"domain": "www.example.net",
					"title": "Sofa",
					"description": "This is a big sofa",
					"url": "http:\/\/www.example.net\/fruniture\/sofa\/page.php",
					"image": "http:\/\/images.example.net\/super-sofa.png",
					"price": "10 BTC (150 USD)",
					"marketing": "advertisement"
				}
			]
		}

	Here is a description of the variables.

		* domain: A string containing the homepage for the business or merchandise. It can either be a partial domain such
			as "example.com", a FQDN such as "store.examle.com", or even a partial URL in cases like
			"www.craigslist.org\/bitcoin-merchandise".
		* title: A string containing the title of the business or merchandise. In general, the string will not exceed 256
			characters.
		* description: A string containing a full description of the product or service. In general, the string may exceed
			1024 characters.
		* url: A string containing the URL to the webpage where the business or item may be found.
		* image: A string containing the URL to an image of the business or merchandise. The dimensions of the image are
			almost always such that the image will fit inside a 50 x 50px box. However, the dimension of some images
			will exceed this box size.
		* price: A string containing the price of the item. If the item is sold in bitcoin directly the string will be of
			the form "xxx BTC". If the product is sold in another currency like USD, but the vendor accepts bitcoins,
			the format of the price will be "xxx BTC (xxx USD)". The price is not guarenteed to be correct (fluctuations
			in currency value make it impossible to keep the prices always up to date). The price is not know for most of
			the items in our database, so often this field will be "null".
		* marketing: A string indicating if Search Bitcoin has marketing arrangements with the website in the search request.
			If the string is "none" then the search result is unbiased by any marketing agreement. If the string is
			"affiliate" then the link contains an affiliate marketing code but the search result is still unbiased by any
			marketing agreement. If the string contains is "advertisement" then the search result has been biased by a
			marketing agreement.
